Stratified Querk Wide AR Mesh Network AI

SQWARM is VDI's Flagship static autonomy ecosystem. 

We don't make ypu pay for corporate sociopathic "services" that give all your data for flimsy products that make you pay forever. We build systems you lease for development rates that YOU RENT OUT TO OTHERS.

You've watch global sociopaths close off your devices, making you pay for your own hardware's functionality while stealing your data and ad bombing everything.  NO MORE. You can 

Meshnetworks like SQWARM AI let you lease and ooerate open source software with many closed binary OEM devices that coordinate and cooperate autonomously. You set the policy, you get the returns. 

## What's a Querk? ##
A Querk is an autonomous device working in your mesh for YOU.  It plugs in and gives you a web browser explanation of capabilities.  You set policy and it operates 


## HOW DOES IT ALL TIE IN? ##

ALL VDI PROJECTS HAVE 4 PARTS: *PLAN*, *PLATFORM*, *PROTECTION*, AND *PAYLOAD*

We publish the *Plan* in the open on github, and offer any organization to join the VDI Ecosystem to expand by planning more capabilities. These remain open source under GPL. Anyone can consider investing and improving *Plan* by way of use cases, application recommendations, and so on.

We customize hardware from any manufacturer to deliver plan-compliant systems as the *Platforms*. These remain company proprietary or held by organizations making a VDI project via prototype proposal. VDI can deliver *Platforms* or recommend partners to deliver local implementations of global designs.

*Protection* is classified and can vary by VDI local implementations of global designs.
*Protection* are non standard design elements. 

*Payload* is the object of these security and defence systems. Any deliverable or outcome from data delivery to end effects in mission areas
